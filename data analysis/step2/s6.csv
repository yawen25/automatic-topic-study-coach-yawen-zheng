b8,"Manual Computation• Of course, a human can read texts, identify opinions, and detect nuances, but at what cost? – Manually tagging opinions can be arduous, given that the amount of data businesses receive is constantly growing. – Researchers who collected qualitative data (interviews, open ended questions) would use this method – We will do this in Session 8 under “Qualitative Data Analysis”"

b14,"How to do it – Example A• Essentially, you want to answer the questions: Are customer who bout this cast-iron waffle maker happy with the product? Does the average rating score for the product match the sentiment analysis? • Sentiment = (Positive - Negative)/(Positive + Negative)"

b17,"Case Study A• The MASY program director is interested in making sure the MASY students are satisfied with the program. There were major changes during the pandemic in all classes online. Did that cause a lot of dissatisfaction? • She ran a survey polling students on how they feel about online modality. She did not quantize her survey but used open ended questions. • She hires you to analyze the survey results • You have one tool to use, sentiment analysis suing Excel, how would use it to give her an answer? Compare the results to what a commercial analyzer would do (use Google NLP API in demo mode)"
b18,Case Study A• Use the response to the survey collected by your instructor. • Your team should create a table of the results in Excel. • Read over the responses – brainstorm with your team at least 10 positive and 10 negative single word terms to use for sentiment analysis • Use Excel and the COUNTIF function to generate a sentiment score using these 20 keywords • Use question 1 for sentiment analysis. • You may repeat for question 2 and see if you obtain the same result but it is not required. • Use the question 1 data and the Google NLP API demo function to generate a similar score – compare the two. Explain any discrepancies • What would you report to the program director about hwo students feel about online classes?
