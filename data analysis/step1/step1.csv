two,"Framing Analytical Questions CRISP–DM is the Leading Process Methodology CRISP–DM is the Leading Process Methodology The Critical Step in Text Data Mining is: Framing The Question Framing the Question How Does Data Become Knowledge? Where does this analysis fit in the Data Mining Process? Where does this analysis fit in the Data Mining Process? Where does this analysis fit in the Data Mining Process? Business Understanding: What is the Information Need? How do we Recognize an Information Need? How do we Recognize an Information Need? Business Understanding: Discovering the Context of Project What are some of the questions to help us discover the context? Identify the KPI The Gap Question Do Your Homework THE CRITICAL STEP IN ANALYTICS: FRAMING ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS THE CRITICAL STEP IN ANALYTICS: FRAMING ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS First, Dig Deeper Then Parse the Information Request Parsing the information need and three framed analytical questions Use SMART to Frame High-Quality Questions These are the Key Step In Framing Questions"
three,"Data Preparation Data Preparation and the CRISP-DM Process Acquiring, cleaning and organizing data takes up 80% of time of an analyst’s time The Data Cleaning Cycle ""Where does data preparation fit in the world of the analyst? "" The World of Data and Variables Where are Variables Defined? Example Data Dictionary Digital Encoding of Data Character Encoding Character Encoding Schemes Early Form of Encoding: Morse Code A more efficient code for transmission: The Baudot Code A modern Code for the Computer Era: ASCII-7 Codes Compared Unicode UTF-8 UTF-8 Encoding Data Types Data Storage Organization Protocols Some Data Storage/Organization Protocols Comma Separated Values Delimiter Separated Values Comma Separated Values Wrappers CSV Example Format of Files for Easy Analysis Case Study: Flat File Format Flat File Format Case Study: Is this a Flat File?
