b3,"Acquiring, cleaning and organizing data takes up 80% of time of an analyst’s timeWhat does this mean? What do data scientists spend most of their time doing? Building trainning sets 3%, refining algorithms 4%, other 5%, mining data for parents 9%, collecting data sets 19%, cleaning and organizing data 60% The more tools you know and the cleverer you are in shaping a data set the sooner to get to analysis."
b4,"The Data Cleaning Cycleimport data, merge data sets, standardize, normalize, rebuild missing data, de-duplicate, verify and enrich, export data, the data cleansing cycle"

b6,"The World of Data and VariablesTwo kinds of data, four kinds of variables, Free Text  Customer opinions Survey text responses Word frequency, keywords, similarity Categorical Nomínal Cities Stores Gender Color Product Ordinal Years Months Ratings Likert Scale College level Age Summarize by counting, tabulate, frequency, Numeric {2.27,3.56.67.8} decimal {1,2,3,4,5} integer Likert Scale Age You can do math, apply formulas, summarize Numeric Date 11/12/21 as a date 48280.23 as a number Date Math on dates to get differences in months, minutes, etc."
b7,Where are Variables Defined?• Datatablesshouldcomewithinformationaboutthevariablesandthe nature of the rows of data – it is called metadata (data about the data) • Thedefinitionsareinatableorseparatedocumentcalledthedata dictionary • Itshouldbeconsultedwhendoingdatacleaning-itgivestherangesand possible values
b8,Example Data Dictionary• The data file with survey responses for the San Francisco passenger survey has a typical associated data dictionary – https://www.flysfo.com/media/customer- survey-data • The data dictionary can be found in one of the tabs in the Excel data set
b9,Digital Encoding of Data• Words and number storage in a digital computer • Digital computer stores and manipulate data as 0’s and 1’s – 001101001000111001111001010001000100 • Must encode language and expressions into sequence of zeros and ones • Digital Codes – What are some early examples of encoding of language for storage and transmission? – https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding
b10,"Character Encoding• If you use anything other than the most basic English text, people may not be able to read the content you create unless you declare what character encoding you used. • For example, you may intend the text to look like this: • but it may actually display like this:"
b11,"Character Encoding Schemes• Words and sentences in text are created from characters. Examples of characters include the Latin letter á or the Chinese ideograph or the Devanagari character • Characters that are needed for a specific purpose are grouped into a character set . • To refer to characters in an unambiguous way, each character is associated with a number, called a code point. • The characters are stored in the computer as one or more byte"
b12,"Early Form of Encoding: Morse CodeMorse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment."
b13,A more efficient code for transmission: The Baudot Code5-character code for encoding of the characters in the English language
b14,A modern Code for the Computer Era: ASCII-77-bit code for encoding of English characters and control codes • What’s the 7-bit sequence for they letter A? • 01000001
b15,"Codes Comparedmessage, morse, baudot, ascii-7, uft-8"
b16,"Unicode UTF-8• UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication. • Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format – 8-bit. • It can encode over 1 million unique characters • The most common set uses 4 bytes per character • As an analyst, you should nowadays always choose the UTF-8 character encoding for your content or data. This Unicode encoding is a good choice because you can use a single character encoding to handle any character you are likely to need. This greatly simplifies things."
b17,"UTF-8 Encoding UTF-8 uses 1 byte to represent characters in the ASCII set, two bytes for characters in several more alphabetic blocks, and three bytes for the rest of the BMP. Supplementary characters use 4 bytes."
b18,"Data Types• Characters or character data – “A”, “B”, “C”...”a’, “b”, “c”... “%”, “#”, “@”...”+”, “/”, “=“... • Numeric – Numeric data is defined as data which consists of digits as opposed to letters of the alphabet of special characters. – Integer 1,2,3,4 or 34590 or 12863456223 – Decimal 4.56 or 3.1417 or 17032.45002 – Floating point 3.78E12"
b19,"Data Storage Organization Protocols• A way to organize what the stored data means so computer programs can interpret them properly • Meta data about the stored characters – the character set • What does each character mean? Context! • Whenisa“2”a2? – a character as in “21 Jump Street” – An integer as in 2 items – Or part of a decimal as in 8.2 ounces – Or part of a floating-point number as in the circumference of the earth is 2.49E3 miles – A code (a category, a label) as in 1=male, 2= female"
b20,"Some Data Storage/Organization Protocols• File structures – CSV
– JSON
– XML and HTML – XLS, XLXS
• Usually identified by the file extension: – .csv, .json, .xml, .xsl, xlxs"
b21,"Comma Separated Values• A comma-separated values (CSV) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form • Plain text means that the file is a sequence of characters, with no data that has to be interpreted instead, as binary numbers. • A CSV file consists of any number of records, separated by line breaks of some kind; each record consists of fields, separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal comma or tab. • Usually, all records have an identical sequence of fields."
b22,"Delimiter Separated Values• Formats that use delimiter-separated values (also DSV) store two- dimensional arrays of data by separating the values in each row with specific delimiter characters. • Most database and spreadsheet programs are able to read or save data in a delimited format. • Any character may be used to separate the values, but the most common delimiters are – comma (CSV) – tab – colon"
b23,"Comma Separated Values• In a comma-separated values (CSV) file the data items are separated using commas as a delimiter • Column headers are sometimes included as the first line, and each subsequent line is a row of data. • The lines are separated by newlines. • Example"
b24,"Wrappers• Note the use of the double quote to enclose each field. • This prevents the comma in the actual field value from being interpreted as a field separator. • This necessitates a way to ""escape"" the field wrapper itself, in this case the double quote; it is customary to double the double quotes actually contained in a field as with those surrounding ""Hank"". • In this way, any ASCII text including newlines can be contained in a field."
b25,CSV Example
b26,"Format of Files for Easy Analysis• Most analysis programs require that the data file be in a simple tabular form • The columns are variables with the name of the variable at the top of the column • The rows are the values of the variables for each instance of the data set • The rows in the table are all about the same thing – We don’t mix information about the characteristics of cars for sale in the lot with detailed customer information – one is an inventory file, the other a customer information file. • We shape tables of information to have this structure – called a flat file or “flat file format”"
b27,"Case Study: Flat File Formateach column is a variable, a ""feature"", of the data set, or attributes of the population; each row is an example, or ""instantiation"" of the population"
b28,"Flat File FormatNo empty columns, It is good form to have first cell in A1 position, Do not mix population rows, all rows are from the same population, No completely empty rows, Nothing below the last row, First row is always the variable names and each column must have a name, Nothing to the right of the last column, Not necessary but it is good form to remove all unnecessary formatting of the cells (coloring, bolding, borders, italics)"

b33,Additional Processing• The text files created in Word have an additional element that must be removed – the carriage return • Open the Text file in Word and using the Replace function replace all carriage returns (^p) with a space • Resave it as a text file • It can be scraped into the compute buffer ready to be pasted into a data cell in Excel • Example of not removing ^p and pasting into Excel- error!
