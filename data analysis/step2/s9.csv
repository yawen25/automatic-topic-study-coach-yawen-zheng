b4,"What is Text Similarity Scoring?• Take, for example, these three texts: A - Most mornings, I like to go out for a run. B - Running is an excellent exercise for the brain. C - The lead runner broke away from the pack early in the race. • We want to compare these statements against this one-sentence document: – Thesergeantledtheplatoonintheirdaily run early in the day. • Which of the three texts above is most similar to the fourth text? • The three sentences are the target, and the fourth is our source. In the first step, the algorithm extracts all the terms and produces a Bag-of-Words for each (as we did in early chapters)."
b5,"TF-IDF Scoring• In the next step, the algorithm removes all the stop words (I, to, a). • Then tokenizes and lemmatizes all terms (run and runner get converted to run). • The TF, or term frequency, is computed next (essentially, it performs a word frequency analysis). – But if some words are too frequent, they may not be too interesting (like the word “lawyer” in contracts: we all know they will be there, so they are commonplace and should be downplayed). – The algorithm downplays them by using the inverse of the frequency (the IDF part). We are left with lists of words and their inverse frequencies. • Now we compare the list of words and their score to see if they have words in common and compute a common score normalized to 1 (the cosine similarity score)."
